Hit – is when you request another card from the dealer. 

Stand – is when you want to “stick” or “stay” and don’t want to request any cards.

Double Down – is when you double your initial bet and receive one more card from the dealer, 
              therefore you have the initial two cards as well as one more card from the dealer.
Split a Pair – is when you split the initial two cards you are dealt, but only if they have the same value to each other. 
              If you’ve been dealt two cards with the same value and would like to split them, 
              simply place another bet that’s the same amount as the initial one, but in an area away from the original betting box. 
              After you’ve done that, the dealer will then split the cards with separated bets, 
              in order to create two different hands for you to play.
